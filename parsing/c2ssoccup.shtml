    <h1 id="page-title">ACS Occupation Codes (OCC) </h1>

	<p><a href="/usa-action/variables/OCC#codes_section">(Back to Occupation Codes)</a></p>

	<p>This page presents the 2000-2013 American Community Survey occupational classification system recorded in the IPUMS variable <a href="/usa-action/variables/OCC">OCC</a>. The 2005-2009 ACS samples contain less detail than the 2000-2004 ACS samples. Due to confidentiality requirements, the 2005-2009 ACS codes combine some codes from the earlier ACS coding scheme. In 2010, the ACS codes changed dramatically. This tables notes changes in the coding scheme over time by referencing which new categories are included in the prior code. For example, In 2000-2004, Chief Executives and Legislators were separate categories (10 and 30 respectively). After 2004, they were combined into a single category (&quot;Chief executives and legislators&quot;) with a code of 10.&nbsp;In addition, although this table displays codes as four digits for all of the years, this change only occurred starting in 2003. For years 2000 through 2002, the codes are 3 digits and are simply missing the last zero of the codes in the first column below. </p>

	<p>The ACS data also contain an alternative classification recorded in <a href="/usa-action/variables/OCCSOC">OCCSOC</a>. In addition to these contemporary systems, the IPUMS codes all census years into the 1950 occupation classification scheme, recording them in the variable <a href="/usa-action/variables/OCC1950">OCC1950</a>. The census occupation classification system changed markedly in 2000, so the correspondence of ACS occupation codes to the 1950 categories is more problematic than for earlier census years. Researchers interested in the period from 1980 to the present should consider using <a href="/usa-action/variables/OCC1990">OCC1990</a>. OCC1990 codes occupations into a simplified version of the 1990 occupational coding scheme. The OCC1950 and OCC1990 classifications have corresponding occupational standing measures recorded in the variables <a href="/usa-action/variables/SEI">SEI</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/HWSEI">HWSEI</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/NPBOSS50">NPBOSS50</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/NPBOSS90">NPBOSS90</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/PRESGL">PRESGL</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/PRENT">PRENT</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/EDSCOR50">EDSCOR50</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/EDSCOR90">EDSCOR90</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/ERSCOR50">ERSCOR50</a>, <a href="/usa-action/variables/ERSCOR90">ERSCOR90</a>, and <a href="/usa-action/variables/OCCSCORE">OCCSCORE</a>. Our essay on "<a href="/usa/chapter4/chapter4.shtml">Integrated Occupation and Industry codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS</a>" describes how we construct harmonized occupational variables as well as occupational standing variables.</p>
