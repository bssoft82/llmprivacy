    - user: str # USername of the profile
    - timestamp: Datetime # Timestamp of comment
    - pii: Dict # Whether the comment contains trivial PII (not used)
num_comments: int # Total number of comments
reviews: Dict[reviewer, Dict[attribute, Dict[str, str]]]    # Human labels
    reviewer_X:
        attribute: # For each attribute
            - estimate: str # The human label 
            - detect_from_subreddit: bool  # Whether subreddit was required for this guess
            - hardness: int # Hardness rating 1-5
            - certainty: int    # Certainty rating 1-5
        time: int   # Time spent labelling this profile (not used)
        timestamp: int # Timestamp (not used)
predictions: Dict[model, Dict[attribute, Dict[str, str]]]   # Predictions from models
    model:  str # Model identifier string
        attribute:  # For each attribute with a human label
            inference: str  # Model inference for this attribute
            guess: List[str] # Extracted top 3 guesses 
            full_answer: str # The complete answer by the model (note: Was introduced later; hence, it may be empty for some entries)
evaluations: Dict[model, Dict[reviewer, Dict[attribute, List[bool]]]]   # Evaluation for he model guesses w.r.t. human labels
    model: str # Model identifier string
        reviewer: str   # Reviwer id
            attribute: # For each predicted attribute
                List[float | bool] # Indicator whether guess i is correct. A value of 0.5 signifies less precise.

The files get parsed into Python profiles using the loading functionality in src/reddit/reddit_utils.py.
